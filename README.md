Problem: Early detection and intervention is one of the most important factors in shaping a cancer prognosis. While many regular screenings such as those for cervical, breast, and prostate cancer have been developed, most people are not aware of their existence or participate in these programs. 

Project: We aimed to create a website that educates the public about screenings and helps you easily create a personalized plan to get screened for cancers of which you are at risk for. 

Features: You can enter your health history, lifestyle habits, health insurance plan, demographics (such as age and gender), and zip code information, and it will give you a list of cancer screenings that you should be getting based on your indicated risk factors. For each screening type, it will provide you with the information of local screening centers that provide it and a link to schedule an appointment, filtered based on proximity to your location and out-of-pocket cost/coverage under your health insurance. A google calendar file containing scheduled future reminders at the appropriate time to make an appointment can be exported and imported into your google calendar app.
